I am a cross-disciplinary learner who is interested in many different fields especially about the study of intelligence, computer science, and mathematics. 

From a young age, I've been fascinated by how things work, constantly asking questions and seeking to understand the underlying principles behind everyday phenomena. This curiosity has driven me to explore various domains. I've also read different books about different fields. The book "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind" by Yuval Noah Harari profoundly influenced my perspective on human minds because it explores the cognitive revolution and how our ability to create and believe in shared myths has shaped human societies. Although it is a historical book, it sparked my interest in understanding the human mind from not only a historical perspective but also from psychological and neuroscientific viewpoints. From then on, I started reading more books and articles related to psychology and neuroscience, which further deepened my fascination with the complexities of human cognition and behavior.

I've also been deeply interested in Computer Science from an early age. Learning to code has been a transformative experience for me, as it has allowed me to bring my ideas to life and solve complex problems. I enjoy the logical thinking and creativity involved in programming.

The most interesting course in my high school life was Mathematics. Mathematics is far more than just numbers and equations. It abstracts complex elements from the real world into beautiful structures and patterns, revealing the underlying order and logic that govern our universe. 

I found that artificial intelligence (AI) is a fascinating intersection of these interests. AI combines elements of computer science, mathematics, and cognitive science to create systems that can learn, adapt, and make decisions. The potential applications of AI are vast, ranging from healthcare and education to transportation and entertainment. I am particularly interested in exploring how AI can be used to enhance human capabilities and improve our understanding of intelligence itself.
